# MusicMetadata

An extension that allows the for the extraction, storage, and display of audio file metadata.

Currently supports all metadata already extracted by Godot for `.wav` and `.ogg` format files, certain properties for audio streams that can be defined when importing a audio file, and adds ID3 metadata extraction for `.mp3` format files.
The user may also use this as a means to store manually defined metadata about music tracks, as the data contained is not automatically linked to any changes made after the parsing of a file.

This includes a UI display for metadata, which can be used as an example, or as is.

This plugin is based off of the '[MusicMeta](https://github.com/AineeJames/MusicMeta)' plugin, by [Aineejames](https://github.com/AineeJames) and [Wilcockj](https://github.com/Wilcockj);
with this fork being under the same MIT licence.
